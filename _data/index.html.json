      "question": "Who can attend?",
      "answer": "Anyone that is currently enrolled at a university during the time of this event may compete. If you’re not a student, consider mentoring or volunteering [inc. links for mentor/volunteer signup]!"

    {
      "question": "What should I bring?",
      "answer": "Bring your student ID, laptop, and any other materials you may need as you work on your project - chargers, power strips, keyboards, Raspberry Pis, etc. We also recommend you bring toiletries and a change of clothes so you can feel refreshed after working through the night."

      "answer": "Do not bring any kind of drugs, weapons, or alcohol."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can I hack on?",
      "answer": "Although we strongly encourage you to hack on something that will benefit other students or peers, you are free to hack on anything, as long as it is within the Code of Conduct standards. We will be providing various resources (expand on this once we have info from sponsors - APIs, hardware, etc) and you are free to bring outside materials as well (see What should I bring?)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don’t have an idea?",
      "answer": "Don’t worry! Many hackers arrive with no idea of what they’ll want to make. We suggest you take a look at the resources our sponsors will be providing and come prepared to chat with other hackers, whether you’re looking for a team, a great idea, or just to meet new faces."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don’t have a team?",
      "answer": "git gud"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will there be food?",
      "answer": "We’ve got you covered - we’ll be providing enough food and caffeine to power you through the entire hackathon. You’re welcome to bring any snacks and drinks (again, no alcohol) you absolutely can’t live without as well."
