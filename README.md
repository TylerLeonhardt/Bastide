# Bastide
The little engine that could (and does!) run KnightHacks.org and related services. Somehow.

## Running the full stack

TODO: make less tedious
```
npm install
# import tables
cd frontend/
npm install
bower install
gulp
cd ..
iojs index.js
```

## Running just the website with no API

```
cd frontend/
npm install
bower install
gulp
```
